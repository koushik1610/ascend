# Changelog

All notable changes to S.P.I.D.E.R. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased] — v1.0 hardening
Working through the v1.0 readiness review (`docs/ROADMAP.md` "Path to v1.0").
- **`/spiderui` runs in the browser, not the terminal.** The console now shows **live progress** — a
  phase board *and* an activity feed — instead of telling you to switch to the terminal. The pipeline
  writes `current`/`log` into `.spider-state.json`; the console polls and renders it.
- **Permissions pre-approved.** A scoped, committed `.claude/settings.json` lets the run go **straight
  through without approval prompts** (broad Read + web research; Write/Edit limited to `workspace/**`;
  a short Bash allow-list; a deny-list for `sudo`/`curl`/`rm -rf /`/secrets). Documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Server clears stale `.ui-ready` flags on new intake so a run can't mis-route.
- **Security:** hardened the `/spiderui` local server against CSRF + DNS-rebinding (Host allowlist,
  per-session token on `/api/*`, Origin check on POST, stricter path-traversal guard). Verified live.
- **Honesty:** added a **Project status** + **Known limitations** section and marked beta the surfaces
  that haven't been run end-to-end on real data (`/spiderui`, the cron daily-brief, and the newer
  on-demand ops). Softened "validated JSON" wording (the generator checks it parses; there's no
  separate validator).
- **Fixes:** removed a dead `resume-audit.md` link from the default dashboard and stale prompt refs
  (the résumé audit is folded into the master résumé); the bridge now clears the `.ui-ready` flag on
  pickup so a stale flag can't mis-route a run.
- Console gets a subtle spider-web backdrop (`images/spider_unsplash2.jpg`, Unsplash-licensed) served
  via a new `/images/` route; `images/` is gitignored with a cleared-file allow-list.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-14
A graphical front end so starting SPIDER is point-and-click, not typing.

### Added
- **`/spiderui` — the SPIDER console.** A local, Jarvis-style browser wizard: typewriter intro → 5-step
  intake (LinkedIn *"yes (pick folder) / no (show me how)"*, résumé, target roles, honest calibration,
  optional daily-brief time) → live pipeline progress board → **Open my dashboard**.
- **`ui/server.py`** — a dependency-free (Python 3 stdlib) localhost-only control server: native
  folder/file pickers, writes `intake.md`, installs the daily-brief schedule, reports progress, serves
  the dashboard. Never touches the network.
- **`ui/index.html`** — the self-contained console (dark brand tokens, talks only to the local server).
- **`ui/run-daily-brief.sh`** — cron wrapper that **auto-detects `claude` / `gemini` / `codex`** and
  runs the Daily Briefing headlessly; the console schedules it via cron (macOS/Linux; Windows = Task
  Scheduler note).
- `ui/README.md` — how the console works, with the honest engine/free-tier limits (a free *web-chat*
  tier can't read local files; you need a local agent CLI; the UI + scheduling need only Python).

### Notes
- The console is optional sugar — the text `/spider` flow does the same thing in chat.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-14
First cut of the market-research roadmap (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, built from a 5-surface council on how
people actually use AI for job hunting). Adds the highest-leverage, honesty-aligned P1 features — all
on-demand, keeping the default run lean.

### Added
- **Explainable Job Match Score (0–100)** on every job (skills / seniority / comp / location /
  excitement, each 0–20, with reasoning). Shows on the queue, the navigator job board, and the
  `score <JD>` op. (P1 #3)
- **Warm-Network Mapper** (`prompts/11-network-map.md`, `/spider network`) — mines the `Connections.csv`
  already in the LinkedIn export to surface real warm referral paths per target company and the likely
  recruiter/HM; feeds referral-first outreach. No scraping, no invented contacts. (P1 #1)
- **Application Answer Sheet** (`prompts/12-answer-sheet.md`, `/spider answers`) — reusable, **varied**
  honest answers to common application questions + per-job custom screeners. The honest substitute for
  paywalled autofill; avoids the identical-answer "AI applicant" tell. (P1 #8)
- **Daily Briefing** (`prompts/13-daily-briefing.md`, `/spider today`) — a ~20-min action loop, plus a
  **ghost-detector + follow-up engine**: per-application aging timers that draft the follow-up (or call
  "move on" and replace the target). (P1 #9 + #12)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — the full P1/P2 backlog with sources and a "deliberately not building" list.

### Changed
- Application-log template now tracks `applied_on` / `last_contact_on` / `next_followup_due` so the
  ghost-detector and navigator have real dates.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-13
A simplification + re-targeting release (from a second council review). Same capabilities, far less
speculative output, and a modern README.

### Changed — leaner workflow (the headline)
- **Tiered job folders.** A folder is now a **CORE apply pack** (`resume.md` · `outreach.md` ·
  `application-log.md`) built only for the **top 3–5 jobs you commit to**, plus a **deep interview-prep
  pack** built **on demand** when a screen is booked (`prompts/10-deep-prep.md`, `/spider prep <NN>`).
  A first run now produces ~25–30 files instead of ~100 — no deep prep for leads that never call back.
- **Resume audit folded into the master resume** (was a standalone Phase 2). Keyword set is derived
  once (master §4) and reused downstream instead of re-computed per phase.
- **Default order is now 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 5 → 7**, with 02/08/09/10 on demand.

### Added — targeting the real objective (interviews, not paperwork)
- **Weekly action loop + scoreboard** on the navigator: apply-N / ask-N-referrals targets and a
  referrals→applied→screening→onsite→offers funnel up top; `"SPIDER today"` action list.
- **Referral-first hard gate** in `application-log.md` — can't mark "applied" until a referral was
  attempted or explicitly waived.
- **Mock-interview drill** in the on-demand prep pack (reps, not just reading).
- Single-source job status (`application-log.md` → navigator JSON) to prevent drift.

### Added — brand & docs
- `assets/spider-banner.svg` (static, dashboard-token brand mark) and a modernized README: banner,
  badges, tagline, demo-GIF slot, collapsible sections, ASCII spider, "see a fictional run" link.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-13
First public version. A reusable, Claude Code-driven job-search pipeline.

### Added
- **7-phase pipeline** (`prompts/00-orchestrator` + `01`–`07`): intake interview → LinkedIn analysis
  (HTML + 10 next steps) → resume audit → master resume → 15+ job search → per-job folders (8 files
  each) → interview packet → `start-here.html` navigator.
- **Utility phases:** `08-export-pdf` (ATS-safe Markdown→PDF) and `09-maintenance` (weekly job
  refresh + diff, outreach cadence, follow-ups/deadlines, comp research, retro-learning digest).
- **Templates:** job-folder 8-file spec, master-resume, signal, job-queue, interview-packet,
  `resume-print` (ATS-safe print shell), and two self-contained dashboards (linkedin-analysis,
  start-here) driven by a JSON data block the generator checks parses.
- **Reference rules:** ATS/keywords, resume-writing, number-&-honesty policy, interview-prep framework.
- **Resumability:** `.spider-state.json` run manifest + `resume`, `job add`, `job rebuild`, `score`,
  `export`, `maintenance` operations via the `/spider` command.
- **Privacy model:** everything personal under gitignored `workspace/`; PII banners on both dashboards;
  a fictional worked example under `examples/sample-run/`.
- **Docs:** comprehensive `README`, `START-HERE`, non-technical `docs/SETUP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING`,
  `.github/` issue & PR templates.

### Fixed
- **Privacy:** closed a `.gitignore` re-include hole where personal data dropped into
  `examples/`/`templates/`/`reference/`/`prompts/` was not ignored. Verified with `git check-ignore`.

### Honesty
- Reframed the job-search promise to an honest "15+ candidates, N independently link-verified" with a
  real per-link fetch/status gate, instead of asserting all links are live.
